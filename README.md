# Spiral explorer

**Status: WIP / DOA**

_I created this repo to deepen my understanding of [spiral tiling](https://codepen.io/collection/nYWPBp). I learned what I was hoping to discover before finishing / polishing the code, but I still consider the job done. I'm uploading the scraps here for reference; don't expect a working app._

## What is it?

This is a quick sandbox for exploring [single-line, tiling spirals](https://codepen.io/collection/nYWPBp). I discovered them a few years ago; since then I've found them mysterious, alluring, and beautiful.

I make artwork out of these. I'm using this iteration as the basis for my next thing:

## About the code

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Run it with `yarn start`. At some point, it'll be worth running `yarn eject`.
